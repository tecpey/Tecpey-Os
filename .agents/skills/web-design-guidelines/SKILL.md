# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the project-pinned `GUIDELINES.md` beside this skill
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Use the vendored, source-pinned `GUIDELINES.md` beside this skill. Do not fetch a mutable upstream `main` during review. The pinned source commit is recorded in `/.agents/SKILLS_LOCK.md`.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `GUIDELINES.md` beside this skill
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
